# Motivation <a name='motivation'></a>
I used a dataset with information about Airbnb activities in Seattle provided on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle/data) to answer the following questions:
1) Which property types are available?
2) How is the price per accomodate distributed? 
3) Are the price fluctuation over the year?
4) Can a linear regression model be used to model the price per accomodate? 

# File Description <a name='file-description'></a>
The data analysis is shown in the jupyter notebook `main.ipynb`. Additional functions are implemented in the file `utils.py`

# Results <a name='results'></a>
The main findings can be found in the blog post here.

# Acknowledgements <a name='acknowledgements'></a>
The data used can be found on Kaggle, see the link above.
Besides this I enriched the dataset through geographic data:

In addition, I found some inspiration on this blogpost:
